Mini-Geodome
============

This is a 3D printed minature geodesic dome.

After building a full size Geodesic dome, I decided that it would be neat to 3D print one.

I made similar hubs in SketchUp that
we used in real life and exported them to STL to try and print them. Because of their unique shape, there is no good flat surface
to print them on. I had to experiment with many different custom MakerBot profiles until I was able to get a truly succesful print.

Since there are so many hubs in eveb a basic dome model, I wanted to be able to print these en-masse and not have to do any
manual labor on each hub to clean up support material. I think you'll find that printing with this profile will give you enough
support, and it can be easily removed.

The custom profile which you see here expands the amount of support material so the prints don't fall over. It also increases
the gap slightly between the model and the hubs. This makes the support material very easy to remove. Somtimes you can get little
burrs on the hubs but that's OK as it will grip the straws better.

For the straws you're going to need a lot. I used these ones from Amazon:

Whatever straws you get, make sure that you measure the inner diameter with a caliper. You're going to want them to fit snug on each hub. What I did was get straws, and then go into SketchUp and scale the hub models. I exported to STL and did a test print for fit. Once I got that right I printed them in large quantities. You'll want to spot check as you go along. Make sure you use a fresh straw because the ends get flared if you use them over and over. I kept one test straw and just kept cutting the end off each time I used it.

You're going to need to cut them all to length, and for that I made a handy calculator:

A pair of scissors, or a cigar cutter works well for cutting these. I even made a rig out of an old ruler and some hot glue
so that I could do repeat cuts over and over again.
